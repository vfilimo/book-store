# Book store API

![Project Screenshot](images/book_store_baner_1.png)


## üöÄ Introduction

The Online Bookstore API is a multifunctional system designed to manage unlimited books in your store.
This application offers a user-friendly interface for administrators and customers, 
providing a comprehensive toolset for efficiently managing the bookstore. 
The project focuses on the server-side, providing a stable and flexible foundation for future development.

## ‚ú® Inspiration

This project was inspired by the desire to create a simple and efficient server-side system for managing a bookstore.
The inspiration came from observing existing solutions, which are often overly complex and bloated with features.
I aimed to develop a minimalist and straightforward API that easily integrates with external clients, 
allowing administrators to efficiently manage the book catalog and users to conveniently interact with the store.

* Spring Security: Ensures application security with features such as authentication and authorization.
* Spring Data JPA: Simplifies the data access layer, facilitating interactions with the database.
* Swagger (Spring doc OpenAPI): Enables comprehensive API documentation, easing developer understanding and interaction.

### Database:

  * MySQL: A reliable and scalable relational database management system.
  * H2 (for testing): An in-memory database that provides a lightweight solution for testing and development.

### ORM and Database Versioning:

  * Liquibase: Manages database schema changes and version control.
  * Hibernate:  A robust ORM framework that simplifies database interactions.

### Containerization:

  * Docker: Containerizes the application for consistent and portable deployment.

### Mapping:

  * MapStruct: Simplifies the implementation of mappings between Java bean types.
  * Lombok: Reduces boilerplate code through annotations, enhancing developer productivity.

### Authentication and Security:

  * JSON Web Tokens (jjwt): Ensures secure user authentication.

### Testing:

  * Spring Boot Starter Test: A comprehensive testing framework that simplifies the testing of Spring Boot applications.
  * Test-containers (MySQL, JUnit): A Java library that provides lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases and other services for testing.
  * Spring Security Test: A module that supports testing Spring Security components.

### Build Tools:

  * Maven (with Checkstyle and Compiler plugins): A powerful build automation tool used for managing project dependencies and lifecycle.
    * Checkstyle plugin: helps maintain code quality by enforcing coding standards.
    * Compiler plugin: ensures that the project compiles with the specified Java version, improving build consistency and reliability.

### üîê User Authentication:

| HTTP Request | Endpoint        | Description                                                   |
